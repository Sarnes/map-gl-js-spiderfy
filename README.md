Spiderfy for Mapbox GL JS


**In Development**
things to remember when going open source:

- push our plugin to mapbox and leaflet pages, to make us known
- publish article on nazka-website about this
- make it easy workable via npm package
- write very nice readme with even a demo,  in mapframe mapp
- give some context on nazka and its core business
